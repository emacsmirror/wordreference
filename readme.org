* wordreference.el

This package allows you to query the dictionaries at https://wordreference.com from within emacs.

It displays terms, part of speech, links to conjugation tables (shown as =â–¦= or =#=), contextualizing terms, example sentences, usage infomation, notes, other entries the term is found in, and links to forum entries.

The sole entry point is =wordreference-search=.

You can customize the default source and target languages =wordreference-source-lang= and =wordreference-target-lang=. If you call =wordreference-search= with a prefix argument, you can also choose your languages interactively.

The package has been tested with French <> English and Portuguese <> English. Other languages work but may not be parsed as well.

** install

=wordreference.el= is available on MELPA.

If you already have it set up, you can simply call =M-x package-install RET wordreference=.

** In the results buffer:

- =w= or =s= to start a new search (mark any word first to search it by default) with the same language pair as last search
- =<tab>= / =<backtab>= to move point backward and forward between entries
-  =<return>= when on an entry to do a new search for that entry
- =click= on a word in an entry to search for just that single word
- =<return>= to open a usage note, conjugation table or forum entry in external browser
- =,= / =.= to go to the previous/next heading
- =b= to view page in external browser
- =C= to copy current search term
- =n= to list and search nearby entries in the dictionary
- =c= to search same term on https://www.cntrl.fr (only works with well-formed French queries)
- =l= to search the same term on https://www.linguee.com
- =r= to search the same term with [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/reverso.el][reverso.el]]
- =S= to swap source and target and search for same term again
- =v= to immediately search most recent item in the kill ring.
